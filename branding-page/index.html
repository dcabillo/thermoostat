											<h2>Branding</h2>
										</header>
									<p>To develop effective branding for your PTS program, we need to make sure it supports who you are as an organization and team. We’ll start with defining your values, then your message architecture, and finally the messaging you’ll use day-to-day to promote your PTS tool. </p>
										<img src="images/threecircles.png" alt="" />
									<h2><b>Your Values: Using the WHY, HOW, WHAT Framework</b></h2>
									<p>“WHATs are products, services and job functions we perform. HOWs are values, guiding principles and actions that make us stand out. The WHY defines what the organization stands for—it is the collective purpose, cause or belief ... When we align emotionally with our customers, our connection is more meaningful than any affiliation based on features and benefits.”
									- Taken from Find Your Why by Simon Sinek
									</p>
									<h3><b>For example: </b></h3>
<p>Our WHY:<br>At the UCD Energy Conservation Office we believe we can reach innovative solutions when we work together. This drives our projects to educate and engage the campus community in using our collective resources efficiently.
<br><br>Our HOW: </p>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>Education</th>
		<th>
			We aim to educate our users in delightful and engaging ways.
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Community</th>
		<th>
			We aim to create a customer-focused community for our users to learn and engage with energy use on campus.
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Stewardship</th>
		<th>
			We will use and help others use resources in a thoughtful, optimal manner.
		</th>
	</tr>
	</table>
	<p>Our WHAT: <br>TherMOOstat is our project to engage the campus in thermal comfort and give them opportunities to be a part of energy conservation on campus.</p>

	<h3><b>Your turn:</b></h3>
	<p>
	Your WHY is your office’s collective purpose. <i>Don’t spend too much time on this, but it is helpful if you can articulate a shared vision. It is also OK if you have several ideas.</i><br><br>
Your HOW are your core values and/or guiding principles. <i>This is important to define for your PTS program. You can use core values given to you by your office or University.</i><br><br>
Your WHAT is Crowdsourcing Campus Comfort. <i>We’ve got you covered on this one.</i></p>

<h2><b>Your Message Architecture: How to communicate your core values</b></h2>
<p><b>A message architecture</b> helps to achieve consensus and clarity around communication goals.<br><br>
“<b>Bold leadership requires vision and direction: that's your message architecture...</b> The message architecture your team establishes at the beginning of the project will help maintain consistency of vision long after the project launches."
-Taken from Content Strategy at Work by Margot Bloomstein</p>

<p>In the table below, <b>circle four of the words.</b> Four are highlighted to show you which four we use at UC Davis, but you are free to choose what’s important to you. Descriptions are provided but you can interpret the words as makes sense to you and your team.  <b>This is your message architecture.</b><br><br>

<h3>Tips from UCD: We have had some success recently by incorporating more about our motivation to save energy in our messaging (keywords to use: “save energy”; “energy efficiency”. We found that doing so diffuses some of the dissatisfaction with thermal comfort--users respond with a willingness to tolerate less comfort if it is in the interest of saving energy.

											<h2>Visual Identity</h2>
										</header>
<p>Visual identity is an important part of your branding. It includes the logos and images you use in your product and communications.
</p>
<p>
<ol>Logos:
	<li>Your department or university wordmark will let students and staff know this tool is official and that you’re using the data to make informed decisions.</li>
	<li>Your optional PTS mascot (if you have one will make the tool fun and memorable for your users.</li>
</ol>

<ul>Images:
	<li>Use images as needed, and try to use photos of your campus instead of generic images. Images that include people are generally more engaging that those that don’t. At UC Davis we have a set of photos with students using TherMOOstat on their phone and these photos have been enough to see us through several years. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The most important thing to remember is <b>consistency.</b> It’s better to use the same logo and image in your emails, fliers and other communications than to use different ones each time. Being consistent will help people remember your PTS tool. </p>

											<h2>Communication Channels</h2>

										<h2><b>How, Where, and When to Distribute Your Message</b></h2>
										<p>You can send out messaging in newsletters, social media postings, fliers, and/or emails. In the table below are the channels we use at UC Davis and the messages we use in each channel. <br>
										Circle the channels you’d like to use to promote your comfort tool and update the messaging in the right column. <br><br> FIXME: INSERT GRAPHIC
										</p>
										<h2><b>Seasonal Promotions</b></h2>
										<p>
										Ongoing promotion of your PTS program is crucial to inform and engage potential users, and to sustain rates of feedback submissions. For example, seasonal promotions remind users about the program at times when indoor conditions and comfort levels are changing. PTS submission rates are typically higher at these times already, and promotions give them an added boost. Seasons change in Davis in April and November, so we promote in May and October, just before the expected boost. If something else is causing a spike in voting, promotions could accelerate it even more, generating lots of useful data.

											<h2>Educational Engagement</h2>
										</header>
										<h2><b>General Comfort Education</b></h2>
										<p>We’ve collected information about how comfort works on a University campus and display it publicly on <a href="https://www.comfort.ucdavis.edu">https://www.comfort.ucdavis.edu</a>. If this information is also applicable to your campus, you're welcome to refer members of your campus to this website. Some items such as seasonal comfort trends or tips for comfort may be applicable across the UC system.
										</p>

										<h2><b>Common Misconceptions</b></h2>
										<p>Through comments left on TherMOOstat, we see common misconceptions about comfort in our campus buildings. These mostly occur because campus buildings operate differently than what most people are used to (our homes), and because some energy efficiency measures are counter-intuitive. <br><br>
											For example, we use economizers on campus to bring in cooler outside air in the morning. TherMOOstat users thought we were wasting energy by cooling buildings when it wasn’t even hot outside: “There is no need to have the AC on this early in the morning, it is already cold outside. The room temperature reflects a comfortable temperature.” This is an example of our team needing to explain a piece of equipment that TherMOOstat users likely never heard of before, because it’s not common for a home to have an economizer. <br><br>
											We also get a lot of comments from TherMOOstat users who feel air blowing all the time, and think something is broken or it's a waste of energy: “It’s like the air is circulating but not cold. So like a perpetual fan mode.” On our Comfort 101 website (comfort.ucdavis.edu) , we explain the CA code to ventilate spaces, the impact of body heat and the need to circulate air, and that constant ventilation helps with air mixing. </p>

										<h2><b>What the Community Wants to Learn</b></h2>
										<p>
											At UCD, we find that students and staff do want to learn about how comfort relates to energy and what projects are going on around campus to save energy. The table below shows a ranking of the top 3 topics that interest students and staff (out of a list of 8 we provided in a survey of 55 students and staff members). We use surveys like this to get feedback on our PTS program and tailor our Comfort 101 website, so we are explaining the concepts people are most interested in on campus. We are happy to share our survey instruments and results with you.

											<tr>
												<th>1</th>
												<th>How does comfort affect people's' learning or work?</th>

											<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Your PTS program will gather a wealth of data, with many possible applications. In addition to triaging incoming data, you will also want team members paying attention to the bigger picture, which includes digging deeper to understand issues, collecting more data, and making decisions about energy efficiency projects based on insights from longer-term data analysis. The human resources required for this aspect include three main roles: Long-term data analysis; site visits; and project management.
										</p>
										<p>
										Long-term Data Analysis: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Analyze PTS data on a quarterly and annual basis. Lots of patterns will only emerge with aggregate, accumulated data. This should amount to about 1 day of work for one person per month on average.</li>
										<li>Analysis should involve triangulation with other data sets, such as room temperature, building metadata, and outside air temperature, so
										access to those additional data sets is required, as are data handling skills, including file-merging.</li>
										<li>If these analyses are performed by someone other than the person who conducts short-term analysis (a student intern does much of the long-term data analysis at UCD), there should be close collaboration between the two.</li>
										</ul>
										</p>

										<p>
										Site Visits: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Conduct site visits</li>
										<li>Install data loggers</li>
										<li>Ability to place and use a temperature data logger, and make observations </li>
										<li>Knowledge of a room’s mechanical system is helpful but not necessary</li>
										<li>Knowledge of the PTS system and key messages </li>
										</ul>
										</p>
										<p>
										Project Management: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Someone who has experience with project scoping and implementation is required to fully leverage PTS data for major projects, e.g., ceiling fan installation to address hot complaints</li>
										<li>Collaboration with engineers and project managers</li>
										<li>This role is not continuous, but as needed. At UC Davis we use at least a year of data to inform a new energy project, and to inform current projects we look at PTS data during and directly following implementation. </li>
										<li>At UC Davis this role is performed by a project manager, but could also be performed by an engineer if they have projects out on campus and need PTS data. </li>
										</ul>

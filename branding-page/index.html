											<h2>Branding</h2>
										</header>
									<p>To develop effective branding for your PTS program, we need to make sure it supports who you are as an organization and team. We’ll start with defining your values, then your message architecture, and finally the messaging you’ll use day-to-day to promote your PTS tool. </p>

<p><h3>Your <strong>WHY</strong> is your program’s collective purpose.</h3> <strong>How It’s Done at UC Davis:<br></strong> At the UCD Energy Conservation Office we believe we can reach innovative solutions when we work together. This drives our projects to educate and engage the campus community in using our collective resources efficiently.
</p><br><br><h3>Your <strong>HOW</strong> are your core values and/or guiding principles.</h3><p><strong>How It’s Done at UC Davis:</strong>

	<ul style="margin-top:-1.5em;">
		<li>Education: We aim to educate our users in delightful and engaging ways.</li>
		<li>Community: We aim to create a customer-focused community for our users to learn and engage with energy use on campus.</li>
		<li>Stewardship: We will use and help others use resources in a thoughtful, optimal manner.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><br><h3>Your <strong>WHAT</strong> describes what you do or the services you provide.</h3>  <strong>How It’s Done at UC Davis:<br></strong>  TherMOOstat is our project to engage the campus in thermal comfort and give them opportunities to be a part of energy conservation on campus</p>



<br><h2><b>Your Message Architecture: How to communicate your core values</b></h2>
<p><b>A message architecture</b> helps to achieve consensus and clarity around communication goals.
<div><img class = "quote" src="images/Branding_Quote_Icon2_Final-01.png" alt=""></div>

<p>Here are a collection of keywords commonly used in message architectures. Typically a program’s message architecture consists of 4-6 keywords that embody your values. The keywords below are a selection of a set developed by Margot Bloomstein.<br>


<div class="chart"> <img class="cell" src="images/Branding_YourMessageArchitectiure_Final_1-01.png" alt="">

<h2><b>Your Messages</b></h2>
<p>Below are examples of how to use your message architecture when drafting outreach and marketing, and communications with PTS users. Not every keyword in the message architecture has an example, because we use limited keywords to strengthen our communications and keep them concise.<br>

											<h2>Visual Identity</h2>
										</header>
<p>Visual identity is an important part of your branding. It includes the logos and images you use in your product and communications. The most important thing to remember is consistency. It’s better to use the same logo and image in your emails, fliers and other communications than to use different ones each time. Being consistent will help people remember your PTS tool.

<!--kiernan said to remove<ol>Logos:
	<li>Your department or university wordmark will let students and staff know this tool is official and that you’re using the data to make informed decisions.</li>
	<li>Your optional PTS mascot (if you have one will make the tool fun and memorable for your users.</li>
</ol>

<ul>Images:
	<li>Use images as needed, and try to use photos of your campus instead of generic images. Images that include people are generally more engaging that those that don’t. At UC Davis we have a set of photos with students using TherMOOstat on their phone and these photos have been enough to see us through several years. </li>

										<h2><b>Seasonal Promotions</b></h2>
										<p>
											Ongoing promotion of your PTS program is crucial to inform and engage potential users, and to sustain rates of feedback submissions. For example, seasonal promotions remind users about the program at times when indoor conditions and comfort levels are changing. PTS submission rates are typically higher at these times already, and promotions give them an added boost. If something else is causing a spike in voting, promotions could accelerate it even more, generating lots of useful data.

											<h2>Educational Engagement</h2>
										</header>
										<h2><b>General Comfort Education</b></h2>
										<p>We’ve collected information about how comfort works on a University campus and display it publicly on <a class="boom" href="https://www.comfort.ucdavis.edu">https://www.comfort.ucdavis.edu</a>. If this information is also applicable to your campus, you're welcome to refer members of your campus to this website. Some items such as seasonal comfort trends or tips for comfort may be applicable across the UC system.
										</p>

										<h2><b>Common Misconceptions</b></h2>
										<p>Through comments left on TherMOOstat, we see common misconceptions about comfort in our campus buildings. These mostly occur because campus buildings operate differently than what most people are used to (our homes), and because some energy efficiency measures are counter-intuitive. For example, we use economizers on campus to bring in cooler outside air in the morning. TherMOOstat users thought we were wasting energy by cooling buildings when it wasn’t even hot outside: “There is no need to have the AC on this early in the morning, it is already cold outside. The room temperature reflects a comfortable temperature.” This is an example of our team needing to explain a piece of equipment that TherMOOstat users likely never heard of before, because it’s not common for a home to have an economizer.  <br><br>
										We also get a lot of comments from TherMOOstat users who feel air blowing all the time, and think something is broken or it's a waste of energy: “It’s like the air is circulating but not cold. So like a perpetual fan mode.” On our Comfort 101 website (comfort.ucdavis.edu) , we explain the CA code to ventilate spaces, the impact of body heat and the need to circulate air, and that constant ventilation helps with air mixing. </p>

										<h2><b>What the Community Wants to Learn</b></h2>
										<p>
											At UCD, we find that students and staff do want to learn about how comfort relates to energy and what projects are going on around campus to save energy. For example, the figure below shows student rankings of their interest in comfort issues in a survey we conducted. We use surveys like this to get feedback on our PTS program and tailor our Comfort 101 website, so we are explaining the concepts people are most interested in on campus. We are happy to share our survey instruments and results with you.

											<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Your PTS program will gather a wealth of data, with many possible applications. In addition to triaging incoming data, you will also want team members paying attention to the bigger picture, which includes digging deeper to understand issues, collecting more data, and making decisions about energy efficiency projects based on insights from longer-term data analysis. The human resources required for this aspect include three main roles: Long-term data analysis; site visits; and project management.
										</p>
										<p>
										Long-term Data Analysis: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Analyze PTS data on a quarterly and annual basis. Lots of patterns will only emerge with aggregate, accumulated data. This should amount to about 1 day of work for one person per month on average.</li>
										<li>Analysis should involve triangulation with other data sets, such as room temperature, building metadata, and outside air temperature, so
										access to those additional data sets is required, as are data handling skills, including file-merging.</li>
										<li>If these analyses are performed by someone other than the person who conducts short-term analysis (a student intern does much of the long-term data analysis at UCD), there should be close collaboration between the two.</li>
										</ul>
										</p>

										<p>
										Site Visits: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Conduct site visits</li>
										<li>Install data loggers</li>
										<li>Ability to place and use a temperature data logger, and make observations </li>
										<li>Knowledge of a room’s mechanical system is helpful but not necessary</li>
										<li>Knowledge of the PTS system and key messages </li>
										</ul>
										</p>
										<p>
										Project Management: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Someone who has experience with project scoping and implementation is required to fully leverage PTS data for major projects, e.g., ceiling fan installation to address hot complaints</li>
										<li>Collaboration with engineers and project managers</li>
										<li>This role is not continuous, but as needed. At UC Davis we use at least a year of data to inform a new energy project, and to inform current projects we look at PTS data during and directly following implementation. </li>
										<li>At UC Davis this role is performed by a project manager, but could also be performed by an engineer if they have projects out on campus and need PTS data. </li>
										</ul>

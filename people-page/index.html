							<p>A successful Participatory Thermal Sensing (PTS) program requires a team with diverse skills to promote the program and maximize the utility of incoming data. The goal of this module is to help you identify the human resources you will need. We begin by describing what it takes to launch a PTS program. We then consider key responsibilities and examples of specific staff roles for ongoing program operations in terms of three main program goals: branding and engagement, analysis and triage, and applications. Finally, job descriptions are provided that you can post to find student intern support.</p>

											<h2>Triage & Analysis Resources</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="margin-right: -35%;">Triage and analysis should be performed by someone knowledgeable about campus energy systems and well-connected with campus HVAC technicians, in order to understand the causes of comfort issues, identify energy inefficiencies, and communicate to get problems fixed. Some communication with PTS users is also important in triage and analysis. Giving users direct and specific information about their reported concerns or significant discomfort communicates your respect for their well-being and also makes for more informed building occupants, building energy awareness on campus.</p>

											<h2>Applications Resources</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Your PTS program will gather a wealth of data, with many possible applications. In addition to triaging incoming data, you will also want team members paying attention to the bigger picture, which includes digging deeper to understand issues, collecting more data, and making decisions about energy efficiency projects based on insights from longer-term data analysis. The human resources required for this aspect include three main roles: Long-term data analysis; site visits; and project management.
										</p>
										<p>
										Long-term Data Analysis: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Analyze PTS data on a quarterly and annual basis. Lots of patterns will only emerge with aggregate, accumulated data. This should amount to about 1 day of work for one person per month on average.</li>
										<li>Analysis should involve triangulation with other data sets, such as room temperature, building metadata, and outside air temperature, so
										access to those additional data sets is required, as are data handling skills, including file-merging.</li>
										<li>If these analyses are performed by someone other than the person who conducts short-term analysis (a student intern does much of the long-term data analysis at UCD), there should be close collaboration between the two.</li>
										</ul>
										</p>

										<p>
										Site Visits: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Conduct site visits</li>
										<li>Install data loggers</li>
										<li>Ability to place and use a temperature data logger, and make observations </li>
										<li>Knowledge of a room’s mechanical system is helpful but not necessary</li>
										<li>Knowledge of the PTS system and key messages </li>
										</ul>
										</p>
										<p>
										Project Management: Key Responsibilities and Requirements
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Someone who has experience with project scoping and implementation is required to fully leverage PTS data for major projects, e.g., ceiling fan installation to address hot complaints</li>
										<li>Collaboration with engineers and project managers</li>
										<li>This role is not continuous, but as needed. At UC Davis we use at least a year of data to inform a new energy project, and to inform current projects we look at PTS data during and directly following implementation. </li>
										<li>At UC Davis this role is performed by a project manager, but could also be performed by an engineer if they have projects out on campus and need PTS data. </li>
										</ul>
										</p>

											<h2>Hiring Student Interns</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Student interns are a great way to supplement your team’s existing human resources for a PTS program. They can help with promotions or assist in analyzing and responding to PTS comfort votes.  
										</p>
										<p>
										Things to keep in mind when hiring students: 
										</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
										<li>Look for certain majors based on the tasks you need done. For example, engineering, economics and/or statistics students do well in data analysis roles, while communications, design, and english majors do well in communication roles; environmental science students are perhaps most versatile.</li>
										<li>For data analysis, we list research questions we’re interested in investigating to keep students on track, e.g., Does the volume of comfort votes correlate with the temperature outside? </li>
										<li>For communications and promotions, we’ve found it helpful to have guidelines for students to follow and sample content for them to pull from, e.g., Always start with “Thanks for using TherMOOstat”. </li>
										</ul>

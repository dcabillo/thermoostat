							<p>The goal of this module is to help other campuses find the human and material resources needed to run a Participatory Thermal Sensing (PTS) program. </p>

							<p>TherMOOstat, or a thermal participatory sensing program, needs a diverse group of individuals to keep the program running and maximize the use of incoming data. In this module, we hope to show you the key roles on our team and how to look for similar skills and/or knowledge in your teams. Although there are several people working with TherMOOstat, they all work part-time on the project, and in sum their time amounts to the equivalent of one full-time employee. </p>
							<p>In this module, we also hope to describe how to find these resources and/or team members on your campus. Our team's success is rooted in our position within the Facilities department, under the UC Davis Energy Manager. We believe this is the best position to affect change with comfort feedback, but other possibilities or partnerships include a sustainability office or student housing group.</p>

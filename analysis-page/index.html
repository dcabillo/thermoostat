						<p>In this module, we hope to guide you through defining your team’s process for triaging incoming thermal comfort feedback submissions. Goals for data triage are to quickly identify any major HVAC operation issues, store data efficiently for later analysis, and communicate back to users as needed.</p>

									<h2>Participatory Thermal Sensing vs. Work Order</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In considering how to handle incoming PTS data, it is useful to review the goals of PTS compared to a traditional work order system. Although both PTS and a traditional work orders can be channels for temperature complaints, they are quite
									different in several ways. See the graphic below for differences in how Facilities staff respond and users options when submitting either a work order or PTS submission.</p>

									<h2>Questions to Consider</h2>

								<p>Here are some questions for your PTS team to consider as you make your plan of attack for dealing with the data:</p>

									<h2>What to Expect</h2>
								</header>

									<h3>Rate of Thermal Comfort “Votes”</h3>
									<ul style="circle">
										<li>Expect about 3 votes per week per building with PTS, on average. (For example, UCD TherMOOstat receives about 106 votes per week from an average of 37 unique buildings.)</li>
										<li>If an energy project is ongoing in a building expect closer to 15 votes per week (provided PTS is promoted to occupants).</li>
										<li>Vote volume will be slower in the summer and higher during Spring-to-Summer and Fall-to-Winter transitions. Users tend not to vote when conditions are comfortable.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Actionable Data</h3>
									<ul style="circle">
										<li>At UCD, most incoming votes (~90%) require no action beyond checking the BAS to find equipment is functioning properly.</li>
										<li>For about 10% of votes, you might find upon investigation that the room temperature is outside the deadband or standard. You might expect to modify temperature setpoints twice per month on average and generate one new work order per month on average based on PTS data (based on UCD experince with campus-wide PTS).</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Communication with Users</h3>
									<ul style="circle">
										<li>Language in the app communicates to users that voting helps Facilities identify issues but is not the same as submitting a work order, so most don’t expect guaranteed or immediate changes when they submit feedback.</li>
										<li>At UCD, we send custom emails to users when they seem to not understand how their building works (e.g., when they don’t realize they can actually control their room’s thermostat). UCD sends less than 10/week on average.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Workflow</h2>
								</header>
										<p>Not all thermal comfort feedback is equal! You will want to respond differently based on a number of factors, such as multiple submissions from the same room around the same time, and users’ tone or extra details given in open-ended comments. The flowchart below depicts general rules we have set for triaging incoming feedback from TherMOOstat and examples of the rules in action. You should decide which of these rules to adopt and any other useful rules tailored to your campus, climate, and community.

										<div class="chart1"><img class="graph1" src="images/Triage_Process_Final.png" alt=""/></div>
										<p>Below are actual scenarios from the TherMOOstat program. Click the button below each to see the corresponding workflow.</p>
									<h3>SCENARIO 1: Temperature Not Meeting the Setpoint</h3>
									<p>When room temperature was outside its deadband, we investigated the issue. In one room, we found an issue with a set point stuck in a manual override. Notes from John the Analyst: “Room setpoint in operator mode at 72°F per HVAC technician. Released 60 degree supply air setpoint (SAS) override on AHU-1 (air handler 1)”

									<button class="button button-hidden" onclick="hidebuttspace()">Hide Scenario 1 Workflow</button>

									<br><h3>SCENARIO 2: Equipment Issue: Failed Room Temperature Sensors</h3>
									<p>In one room, we found an issue with the room temperature sensors.
										Notes from John the Analyst: “2 failed room sensors caused the supply air setpoint on AHU-1 (air handler 1) to remain at 75°F and the Variable Air Volume (VAV) boxes to stay in heating mode.  Supply air setpoint (SAS) is dependent on room temp average and failed sensors caused the room temp average to be set at 38°F. Supply air setpoint has been operated to 55°F until sensors can be repaired.”

									<button class="button button-hidden1" onclick="hidebuttspace1()">Hide Scenario 2 Workflow</button>

									<br><h3>SCENARIO 3: High Volume Feedback Leads to Identifying an Issue</h3>
									<p>29 hot/warm votes came in from one room that led to our triage team identifying temperature and airflow issues. After the issue was fixed in the BMS we sent an email to everyone that submitted feedback to let them know their votes helped us find and fix a temperature issuel.
										<br><br>Button to bring up the email “Click to see the email written to our PTS users.”
										<br><br>“Good afternoon,
										<br><br>Thank you SO MUCH for using TherMOOstat. We’ve gotten a lot of feedback from room 2363 of Academic Surge today, and we wanted to let you know that we’ve read each and every one of your submissions. We also know that it was 78°F in room 2363 today! Yikes!!”
										<br><br>Here’s what was going on:
										<br>There were two sensors in the room that weren’t reading the room temperature properly. These sensors were causing some issues with the rest of the mechanical equipment and the room was too warm with low airflow. It took our team a few hours to investigate this issue and figure out what was going on, but we’ve been able to return the temperature to its normal range.
										<br><br>We were able to find and fix this issue because of your TherMOOstat feedback. Thank you!! We value your feedback, so please let us know how the space feels on Monday, or when you’re next in the room.
										<br><br>Have a great weekend.
										<br>Cheers,
										<br>Kiernan

									<br><h3>SCENARIO 4: High Volume Feedback Leads to Communication with Users</h3>
									<p>After verifying that the room and building are visible in the BMS, we checked that the room temperature and airflow inside the room was within the setpoints. We received many more votes, so we conducted a site visit and left a data logger in the room for a week. This showed that the temperature ranged on average from 71 to 74 degrees Fahrenheit, so there were no issues in the room. We shared these results with users, and gave them the opportunity to learn more from our website.

									<button class="button button-hidden3" onclick="hidebuttspace3()">Hide Scenario 4 Workflow</button>

									<br><h3>SCENARIO 5: Consistent Low Volume Feedback about Known Issue</h3>
									<p>When we got 5 hot votes in the same room, within two days and at the same time of day and from 5 different people, we sent out an email. Even though the room was within its temperature deadband, we wanted to explain how the building works and that we know it has an HVAC system that’s difficult to control for comfort.  We get constant feedback from this building, and have it on our list for a potential ceiling fan project to improve the comfort. We watch the incoming comfort votes for this room to see trends in discomfort.

									<h2>Know Your Users</h2>
									<p>Understanding your users is a big help when it comes to deciding how to respond to their feedback. At UC Davis, we’ve described different kinds of TherMOOstat users based on experience and research with the tool over the past 5 years. We characterize users by their expectations and how much they move around the campus. We suggest actions during data triage based on user segments.</p>

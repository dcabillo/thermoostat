								<p>Not all thermal comfort feedback is equal! You will want to respond differently based on a number of factors, such as multiple submissions from the same room around the same time, and users’ tone or extra details given in open-ended comments. Here is an example of rules you could set for triaging incoming feedback: </p>

									<h2>Understanding Users</h2>
								</header>
							<p>Understanding your users is a big help when it comes to deciding how to respond to their feedback. At UC Davis, we’ve created a matrix that describes different kinds of TherMOOstat users based on experience and research with the tool over the past 4+ years. We characterize users by their expectations and how much they move around the campus.We suggest actions during data triage based on where a user lies in the matrix. A diagram like this helps us decide what actions we will take on incoming feedback, and also helps those new to the PTS understand how to react and respond to comfort feedback. Click the link below to see the matrix.

								<p >To better understand our users and how to triage incoming data, we’ve created a matrix that describes the different kinds of TherMOOstat users on the UC Davis campus. The matrix is informed by research we’ve done at UC Davis and the experience we’ve had with TherMOOstat the past several years.
								Users are described by their expectations and how much they move around the campus. Based on where a user lies in the matrix, we have suggested actions for each area. A diagram like this helps us decide what actions we will take on incoming feedback, and also helps those new to the PTS understand how to react and respond to comfort feedback.

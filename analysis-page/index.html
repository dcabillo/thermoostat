Goals for data triage are to quickly identify any major HVAC operation issues, store data efficiently for later analysis, and communicate back to users as needed.</p>

									<h2>Participatory Thermal Sensing vs. Work Order System</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In considering how to handle incoming PTS data, it is useful to review the goals of PTS compared to a traditional work order system. Although both PTS and a traditional work orders can be channels for temperature complaints, they are quite
									different in several ways. See the graphic below for differences in how Facilities staff respond and users options when submitting either a work order or PTS submission.</p>

									<h2>Questions to Consider</h2>

								<p>Here are some questions for your PTS team to consider as you make your plan of attack for dealing with the data:</p>

									<h2>What to Expect</h2>
								</header>

									<h3>Rate of Thermal Comfort “Votes”</h3>
									<ul style="circle">
										<li>Expect about 3 votes per week per building with PTS, on average. (For example, UCD TherMOOstat receives about 106 votes per week from an average of 37 unique buildings.)</li>
										<li>If an energy project is ongoing in a building expect closer to 15 votes per week (provided PTS is promoted to occupants).</li>
										<li>Vote volume will be slower in the summer and higher during Spring-to-Summer and Fall-to-Winter transitions. Users tend not to vote when conditions are comfortable.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Actionable Data</h3>
									<ul style="circle">
										<li>At UCD, most incoming votes (~90%) require no action beyond checking the BAS to find equipment is functioning properly.</li>
										<li>For about 10% of votes, you might find upon investigation that the room temperature is outside the deadband or standard. You might expect to modify temperature setpoints twice per month on average and generate one new work order per month on average based on PTS data (based on UCD experince with campus-wide PTS).</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Communication with Users</h3>
									<ul style="circle">
										<li>Language in the app communicates to users that voting helps Facilities identify issues but is not the same as submitting a work order, so most don’t expect guaranteed or immediate changes when they submit feedback.</li>
										<li>At UCD, we send custom emails to users when they seem to not understand how their building works (e.g., when they don’t realize they can actually control their room’s thermostat). UCD sends less than 10/week on average.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Workflow</h2>
								</header>
										<p>Not all thermal comfort feedback is equal! You will want to respond differently based on a number of factors, such as multiple submissions from the same room around the same time, and users’ tone or extra details given in open-ended comments. The flowchart below depicts general rules we have set for triaging incoming feedback from TherMOOstat and examples of the rules in action. You should decide which of these rules to adopt and any other useful rules tailored to your campus, climate, and community.

										<p>Below are actual scenarios from the TherMOOstat program. Click the button below each to see the corresponding workflow.</p>
									<h3>SCENARIO 1: BAS Issue: Temperature Not Meeting the Setpoint</h3>
									<p>When room temperature was outside its deadband, we investigated the issue. In one room, we found an issue with a set point stuck in a manual override. Notes from John the Analyst: “Room setpoint in operator mode at 72°F per HVAC technician. Released 60 degree supply air setpoint (SAS) override on AHU-1 (air handler 1)”

								<p >To better understand our users and how to triage incoming data, we’ve created a matrix that describes the different kinds of TherMOOstat users on the UC Davis campus. The matrix is informed by research we’ve done at UC Davis and the experience we’ve had with TherMOOstat the past several years.
								Users are described by their expectations and how much they move around the campus. Based on where a user lies in the matrix, we have suggested actions for each area. A diagram like this helps us decide what actions we will take on incoming feedback, and also helps those new to the PTS understand how to react and respond to comfort feedback.
